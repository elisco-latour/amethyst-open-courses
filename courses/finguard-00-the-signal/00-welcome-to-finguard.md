# Welcome to FinGuard

You are about to begin a journey that will transform you from someone who writes code into a **Software Engineer**.

## The Mission

FinGuard is a **Real-Time Fraud Detection & Regulatory Reporting System** for the banking industry. By the end of this learning path, you will have built a working fraud detection application that:

- **Reads** transaction data from files and databases
- **Analyzes** patterns to detect suspicious activity
- **Alerts** security teams when fraud is detected
- **Reports** to regulators for compliance

This is not a toy project. These are the exact problems that engineers at JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, and fintech startups solve every day.

## Why Banking?

We chose the banking domain for three reasons:

1. **Real Stakes**: Every bug in financial software costs real money. This pressure forces you to write careful, tested code.

2. **Rich Complexity**: Banking involves numbers, dates, text, files, APIs, and databases — you'll encounter every data type and pattern that matters.

3. **Career Leverage**: Financial services pay top salaries because the problems are hard. The skills you build here transfer directly to interviews and jobs.

## How This Path Works

You will build FinGuard incrementally across 14 courses:

| Course | What You Build | Skills You Gain |
|--------|----------------|-----------------|
| **00-04** | Foundation concepts | Data types, variables, control flow, loops, functions |
| **05-08** | Core modules | Functions, exceptions, file I/O, classes |
| **09-10** | Architecture | Inheritance, SOLID principles |
| **11-12** | Quality & Patterns | Testing with pytest, design patterns |
| **13** | Capstone | Complete batch fraud processor |

Every chapter teaches one concept. Every concept is applied immediately to FinGuard. No filler, no busywork.

## The FinGuard Philosophy

We follow three principles:

### 1. Learn by Building
You won't memorize syntax. You'll build features. The syntax becomes automatic when you use it to solve real problems.

### 2. Professional Standards from Day One
Even in your first week, you'll use proper naming conventions, write docstrings, and think about edge cases. These habits compound over time.

### 3. Domain-Driven Learning
Every example uses banking terminology: transactions, accounts, balances, alerts. By the end, you'll speak both Python and Finance fluently.

## What You Need

- **No prior programming experience required** — we start from zero
- **Curiosity** — ask "why?" constantly
- **Persistence** — some concepts take multiple attempts to click

## Ready?

In the next chapter, you'll discover what data actually is — and why computers see the world very differently than humans do.

Let's begin.
